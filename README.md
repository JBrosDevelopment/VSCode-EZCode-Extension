<summary><h2>Example</h2></summary>

This is a simple example of a program where the `X_Scale` and `Y_Scale` print out a square of `char` characters. It outputs a 12 x 10 square of `%` with spaces between the. Look over this code and see if you can follow along with thte comments.

```ezcode
// Set dimensions of square
var x_Scale 12
var Y_Scale 10

// Character for square
var char %

// Create and set the 'txt' var to the correct dimensions
var txt
var interval 0
loop Y_Scale 
{
    interval + 1
    loop x_Scale 
    {
        txt + 'char'\_
    }

    // Check if this is the last row before adding a newline
    if interval <= Y_Scale : txt + \n
}

// Print the output
print 'txt'

// Outputs:
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
// % % % % % % % % % % % % 
```
You can change the `X_Scale` and `Y_Scale` variables as well as the character being used for the square shape.

<summary><h2>Overview</h2></summary>

EZCode is a multipurpose programming language built off of C# and WinForms. It has simple syntax and is designed to be user friendly. Use it no matter your programming experince. From just getting started to a seasoned developer, EZCode can help you develop your projects with a minimal amount of code. Download the **[Official Installer](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/releases/latest)** and choose from the options on what to install.

#### EZCode Player

This is a **neccessary option** for EZCode and will play any EZCode file (.ezcode or .ezproj). It will play the file no matter what type of project it is **(Windows, Console, Console + Visual, or Console + Windows)**.

#### SLN Builder

This is an optional application to install and it creates a Microsoft Visual Studio Project from an EZProject file **(.ezproj)**. Input the project and the desired output directory.

<summary><h3>Modifier</h3></summary>

 Modifier | Use | Example 
----------|-----|---------
// | Does not execute any of the code after the double slash | `var result (x * 5) // The result is the 'X' variable multiplied by 5!`
\| | Starts the next line of code | `var x 10 \| var y 5`
\\! | Value is nothing ('') | `var empty \\!`
\\n | Value of newline | `print Hello\\nWorld!`
\\_ | Value of space (' ') | `file write Hello\_Y'all C:\\path.txt`
~\\ or ~/ | Uses local path | `file play ~\\file.ezcode`
\\; | Value of colon (':') | `if \\; = whatever : `
\\= | Value of equal sign ('=') | `if \\= = whatever : `
\\c | Value of comma (',') | `label name text:Hi\\c everybody!`
\\e | Value of exclamation mark ('!') | `if \\! ! whatever : `
\\$ | Value of pipe ('\|') | `print Agency \\\| Thing`
\\& | Value of semicolon (';') | `shape name bg:[name\\;red;50;50]`
\\( and )\\ | Solves equation inside of the backslashed parenthesis | `print Value = \\(10 + 10)\\ // outputs 'Value = 20'`
\\- | Returns a value with the '\\-' taking out the character before it | `var val h3 \| val = 'val'-// `
\\" | Value of single quote (''') | `var val hello \| print \\"'hello'\\"`
'variable' | writes out the value of the variable | `var val Hello \| print 'val' World!`
(equation) | If this is in a place where a number needs to be, it will solve the equation and set the value to it | `shape name x:(10 + 5)`
?(argument)? | If this is in a place where a boolean needs to be, it will solve the equation and set the value to it | `loop ?(0 > 5)? : { }`
=> | Works only after some keywords, but creates a variable from the output of the line | `input console => consoleOutput `
: | Similar to '=>', but instead of creating a variable, it sets a variable to the output of the line | `var consoleOutput \| input console : consoleOutput`

<summary><h3>System and References</h3></summary>

Reference | Use | Example
:-|:-|:-
system:time | gets the current time. Has many formats so see the [Wiki](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/wiki "Wiki contains the official docs") for that. | `print Time: system:time`
system:random | gets a random number from the inputted minumin and maximum | `print Random Number between 1 and 10: system:random:1:10`
system:isnumber | returns _0_ or _1_ depending on if the value is a number or not | `input console => number \| var number? system:isnumber:number`
system:machine | gets infornation about the machine. Has many subreferences so see the [Wiki](https://github.com/JBrosDevelopment/EZCode/wiki "Wiki contains the official docs") for that. | `print User Name: system:machine:username`
system:currentfile | returns the current file being played... if known. | `print Current file: system:currentfile // only really for debugging`
system:currentplaydirectory | gets where the executable application that is running the EZCode file is. | `print Executable Directory: system:currentplaydirectory`
system:space | returns a space. use \\_ instead.
system:newline | returns a newline. use \\n instead.
system:nothing | returns a space. use \\! instead.
system:pipe | returns a space. use \\$ instead.
controlName:propertyName | returns the property value of the control | `shape player \| print X = player:x`
windowName:propertyName | returns the property value of the window | `window main new \| print Title = main:text`
var_or_list_or_group:length | if var, returns the length of the value (ie. 'hello' has length of 5). If list or group, returns how many values are in the list or group. | `var name John \| print Number of Name's letters: name:length \| // or with list \| list names new : John, Sally \| print Number of names in list: names:length \|`
var_or_list_or_group:index | If var, returns the letter that the index corrosponds to (remember index starts from 0). If list, returns the value of the list that corrosponds with the index. If group, it will return the control's name. | `var a abc \| print a:1 // displays 1 \| list b new : ab, cd \| print b:0 // prints ab \| group c new : label1, shape2, shape3 \| print c:2 // returns shape3`
var_or_list:contains | returns _0_ or _1_ if the var's value contains the the inputted value or if a list's value is equal to the inputted value | `var v abcdef \| var contains? v:contains:g // returns 0 \| //Or for list \| list v new : abc, def, ghi \| var contains? v:contains:ghi // returns 1`
value:index_or_length | If there is a value seperated by commas (a,b,c,d), a colon can be put after that and either an index (number), or 'length' and it will return an output | `print 10,20,30:length // outputs 3 \| print 10,20,30:2 // outputs 30 (0 would be 10, 1 would be 20 in this example)`
